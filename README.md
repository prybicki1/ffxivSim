# ffxivSim
Simulator for the FFXIV combat system

Once run, a list of skills that are avialable will appear. Input the name of the skill you want to use. The simulator will pass the time and keep track of all the relevant damage, buffs, and dots applied. Right now, stats, and the parse time are hardcoded, so you will have to adjust these values manually before starting.

NOTE: This project will not work without a corresponding json file that gives access to the correct spreadsheets. I have links in the code to the spreadsheets, make YOUR OWN copy, and generate YOUR OWN json file to access them, then associate that json file in the code.
